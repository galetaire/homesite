## Description and contact

Personal website using my Handshake TLD (_.galetaire_). Handshake is a decentralized DNS naming protocol, more about it here: https://github.com/handshake-org/hsd. Note that for resolving the handshake DNS protocol you will need a resolver since browsers do not support it, consider using Fingertip: https://github.com/imperviousinc/fingertip.
